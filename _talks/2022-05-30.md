Keynote talk at ICPR2021 [Pattern Recognition in Remote Sensing PRRS](http://iapr-tc7.ipb.uni-bonn.de/prrs2020/) workshop.
keynote talk on Quantum Computing for Earth Observation at the [Summer School](https://www.grss-ieee.org/community/groups-initiatives/high-performance-and-disruptive-computing-in-remote-sensing-hdcrs/hdcrs-summer-school-2022/) of the [IEEE GRSS working group on High Performance and Disruptive Computing](https://www.grss-ieee.org/technical-committees/earth-science-informatics/working-group-earth-science-informatics/hdcrs/)

_Abstract:_ The AI-enhanced Quantum Initiative for EO is a recent initiative from ESA Earth Observation Programmes to assess the potential of Quantum Computing for Earth Observation (QC4EO). Indeed, quantum computing has the potential to improve performance, decrease computational costs and solve previously intractable problems in EO by exploiting quantum phenomena. In this talk we will present our current activities for discovering possible synergies between QC and EO, exploring first promising use-cases, and gathering both communities to prepare the ground for the opportunities which will arise with quantum computing developments.
