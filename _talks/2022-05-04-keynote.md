Keynote talk on _AI4EO, Present and Future_ at the [Swiss Remote Sensing Days 2022](https://www.epfl.ch/research/domains/eo/events-and-news/srsd-2022/) in Ascona, Ticino (CH).

_Abstract:_ Recent years have seen a major uptake of Artificial Intelligence in the Earth Observation sector, allowing to automate processes with unprecedented result quality and speed-up. With the first successes, it also appeared clearly that efficient schemes have to be devised to deal with peculiar problems of Earth systems e.g., the abundance of sensed data, the scarcity or unreliability of reference data, or the physical nature of EO data and phenomena. This talk will present current approaches explored to overcome these issues and some future directions with high potential.
