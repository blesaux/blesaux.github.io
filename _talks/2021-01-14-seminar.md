Seminar given as part of [Dutch AI Technical Session](http://wijsmetlocatie-8026719.hs-sites.com/blog/save-the-date-technische-ai-sessie) organised by [Netherlandsâ€™ Kadaster](https://www.kadaster.nl/).

_Abstract:_ More  and  more  data  (and  their  corresponding  meta-data)  have  allowed  the  wide adoption  of  automatic  machine  learning  approaches  for  Earth  observation.  These methods, often relying on supervised learning, are designed (and succeed!) to obtain high performances on numerous and ever larger carefully prepared benchmarks. But what happens when you go in the wild? When you cannot trust the labels, or worse, when no labels exist? Domain adaptation and generalisation issues appear, leading to unpredictable results. 
 
In this talk I will present several approaches which learn beyond labels. First, I will present a weak supervision method which allows to train a neural network model when labels are inadequate or noisy. Second, I will talk about continual learning for adapting models with the help of a human-in-the-loop. Finally, I will address semi-supervised learning,  or  how  to  train  models  from  both  labelled  and  unlabelled  data.  All  those approaches  pave  the  way  to  today's  great  challenge  of  Earth  observation:  how  to develop generic models able to handle the plethora of data now available?
