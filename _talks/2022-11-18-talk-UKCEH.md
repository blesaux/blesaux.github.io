talk on AI4EO for environmental purposes at the [UK Centre for Ecology and Hydorlogy](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/).

_Abstract:_ The European Space Agency (ESA) Î¦-lab investigates the use of new Artificial Intelligence methods which can accelerate and transform Earth observation and Earth system modelling. We present a few use-cases in Earth sciences where the physical modelling of phenomena could be combined and improved by machine learning based on observations from satellites and meteorological records. We will discuss air pollution, AI for health, rain prediction, cyclone forecasts, etc.
