Talk at [IROS'13 conference](http://www.ieee-ras.org/component/rseventspro/event/14-iros-2013-ieee-rsj-international-conference-on-intelligent-robots-and-systems), located in [Tokyo Big Sight](http://www.ieee-ras.org/component/rseventspro/location/44-tokyo-big-sight-tokyo-japan) - Tokyo, Japan.

Abstract: We propose solutions to provide unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) with features to understand the scene below and help the operational  planning. First, using a visual mapping of the  environnement, interactive learning of specific  targets of interest is performed on the ground control station to build  semantic  maps  useful  for  planning. Then, the learned target  detectors  are  transformed  to  be  applied  to  new  images captured by the UAV. On the technical side, we present: (i) an online gradient boost algorithm to interactively design context-dependent detectors; (ii) a video-domain adaptation method to use object detectors on on-board-camera images. We verify our approach on challenging data captured in real-world conditions.
