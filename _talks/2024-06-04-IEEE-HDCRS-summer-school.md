Invited keynote at IEEE [High-Performance and Disruptive Computing in Remote Sensing (HDCRS) Summer School](https://www.grss-ieee.org/community/groups-initiatives/high-performance-and-disruptive-computing-in-remote-sensing-hdcrs) in Santiago di Compostela, Spain. ([Abstract in the program](https://www.hdc-rs.com/day-1))

_Abstract:_ : Quantum computing is rapidly advancing, bringing the prospect of a new computing paradigm closer to reality. As the race to find practical use cases intensifies, Earth observation has emerged as a promising area, with several prototypes already developed and tested. In this discussion, we will explore some of the latest developments in the field of Quantum Computing for Earth Observation (QC4EO) and highlight the current challenges. Specifically, we will focus on Quantum Generative Artificial Intelligence, including Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models, as well as optimization of Quantum Neural Networks for various Earth observation use cases related to climate change and energy efficiency.
