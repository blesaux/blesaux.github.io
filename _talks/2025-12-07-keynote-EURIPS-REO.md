Keynote at the [EURIPS](https://eurips.cc/)/[Representation Learning for Earth Observation (REO) workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/reoeurips) organised by [University of Copenhagen]() in Copenhagen, Denmark.

_Abstract:_ : [Destination Earth](https://destination-earth.eu/) (DestinE) is a flagship initiative of the European Commission, which addresses the twin Green and Digital transition challenge in our efforts to tackle the impacts of climate change. Kicked off in December 2021 in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA), the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF), and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the initiative aims to develop a digital twin of the Earth, i.e. a highly accurate digital replica of the Earth to model, monitor and simulate natural phenomena and related human activities. 

DestinE unlocks the potential of digital modelling of the Earth system with unprecedented level of detail, quality, and interactivity, to support policymakers to better respond and adapt to environmental challenges posed by extreme events and climate change.

It will also advance scientific knowledge and understanding of the Earth system, by providing researchers with tools to exchange knowledge, conduct research, validate models and test hypotheses about the Earth system and some of the complex and interrelated roles that the environment and people will play in the Earth’s future.
