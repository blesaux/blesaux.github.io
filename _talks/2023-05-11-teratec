Talk and industry panel participation at [Teratec / Thales TQCI day](https://teratec.eu/Seminaires/TQCI/2023/Seminaire_TQCI-230511.html) in Palaiseau France.

_Abstract:_ : 

The AI-enhanced Quantum Initiative for EO is a recent initiative from ESA Earth Observation Programmes to assess the potential of Quantum Computing for Earth Observation (QC4EO). In this talk we present our current activities for discovering possible synergies between QC and EO, considered in the more general framework of modular High-Performance Computing (HPC).

It tris to answer the following technical and high-level questions:
* When QC will be efficient enough for generic applications? Will it be?
* How to apply QC to generic use-cases, classical data?
* How to define a roadmap for applications of QC ?
* How to prepare companies or a full ecosystem for the QC revolution?
