Talk at [Iberic Patt. Rec. and Image Aanlysis conference](http://ibpria2005.isr.ist.utl.pt) in Estoril, Portugal.

Abstract: The  interpretation  of  natural  scenes,  generally  so  obvious  and
effortless for  humans, still remains a challenge  in computer vision.
We  propose in  this  article  to design  binary  classifiers able  to
recognise  some generic image  categories. Images  are  represented by
graphs of regions  and we define a graph edit  distance to measure the
dissimilarity between  them. Furthermore  a feature selection  step is
used to  pick in  the image  the most meaningful  regions for  a given
category and thus have a compact and appropriate graph representation.
