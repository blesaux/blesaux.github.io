_Title_: Diffusion Models for Earth Observation Use-Cases: from Cloud Removal to Urban Change Detection

_Authors_: Fulvio Sanguini, Mikolaj Czerkawski, Lorenzo Papa, Irene Amerini and *Bertrand Le Saux* ðŸ—£

_Abstract:_ :The advancements in the state of the art of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) brought by diffusion models can be highly beneficial in novel contexts involving Earth observation data. After introducing this new family of generative models, this work proposes and analyses three use cases which demonstrate the potential of diffusion-based approaches for satellite image data. Namely, we tackle cloud removal and inpainting, dataset generation for change-detection tasks, and urban replanning.
