Talk and industry panel participation at [Quantum Technologies in Machine Learning](https://qtml-2023.web.cern.ch/) conference 2023 at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland. 

_Abstract:_ : We present the current status of the QC4EO initiaive of ESA, with the definition of the roadmap for the QC x EO developments for the next 15 years, established by 2 consortia of expert insitution in Europe (from academia, supercomputer centres, and industry). We also show examples of promising research in QML: quantum diffusion models for generation of images, quantum geometric lerning, with invariance in circuits for better classification, benchmarking of quantum kernel methods on superconducting qubits and quantum annealers, etc.
