_Abstract:_ : The AI-enhanced Quantum Initiative for EO is a recent initiative from ESA Earth Observation Programmes to assess the potential of Quantum Computing for Earth Observation (QC4EO). Indeed, quantum computing has the potential to improve performance, decrease computational costs and solve previously intractable problems in EO by exploiting quantum phenomena. 

In this talk we will present our current activities for discovering possible synergies between QC and EO, considered in the more general framework of modular High-Performance Computing (HPC). We focus mostly on Quantum Machine Learning, exploring first promising use-cases based on quantum kernels and hybrid quantum-classical neural networks, and gathering both communities to prepare the ground for the opportunities which will arise with quantum computing developments.
