Invited talk at the [Quantum Computing Neural Networks Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya/events/QCNN) in Rome, Italy, organised by [La Sapienza NESYA lab](https://sites.google.com/view/nesya) at the IEEE [IJCNN 2025 Conference](https://2025.ijcnn.org/) (International Joint Conference on Neural Networks).

_Abstract:_ : We present and discuss the interest to look today for applications of quantum computing in downstream applications areas, based on our experience in establishing the quantum computing for Earth observation community. We show the benefits for community and capacity building, in particular for the future workforce, and the technical challenges it brings to both QC and application communities.
