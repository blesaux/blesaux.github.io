Abstract: Content-based image retrieval can be dramatically improved by providing a good initial database overview to the user. To address this issue,  we present in this paper the Adaptive Robust Competition. This algorithm relies on a non-supervised database categorization, coupled with a selection of prototypes in each resulting category. In our approach, each image is represented by a high-dimensional signature in the feature space, and a principal component analysis is performed for every feature to reduce dimensionality. Image database overview is computed in challenging conditions since clusters are overlapping with outliers an
