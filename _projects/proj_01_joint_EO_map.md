Cartography and especially crowd-sourced geographic information like OpenStreetMap is a great way to drive a neural network towards a correct classification. With Nicolas Audebert and Sébastien Lefèvre, we built fusion networks able handle efficiently this new input.

The SpaceNet Challenge round 2 winner is using a similar solution: see his blog post which mentions our paper. OSM as input is promising !
