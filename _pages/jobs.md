We currently have 3 open PhD positions to work on machine learning for scene perception and understanding.

## [Deep neural networks for 3D prediction in the wild](https://w3.onera.fr/formationparlarecherche/sites/w3.onera.fr.formationparlarecherche/files/tis-dtis-2019-39.pdf)

_Co-supervised with Pauline Trouvé-Peloux and Frédéric Champagnat._

3D estimation is crucial for scene understanding (autonomous driving...) and accurate 3D reconstruction (3D mapping, robotics...). However, open environments, outdoors or indoors (“in the wild”) abound with challenging situations which require robust and efficient systems. With [Marcela Carvalho](http://mcarvalho.ml/), we developed award-winning, state-of-the-art approaches to depth estimation by deep learning.

The objective of the thesis project is two-fold. First, to push further this research work by developing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for directly estimating 3D point clouds, instead of depth rasters. Indeed, 3D point clouds are the standard in 3D data acquisition with laser and photogrammetry, and hence in 3D perception. Second, to co-design a smart system able to predict depth in the wild by combining specific camera optics with the adequate deep learning model.
