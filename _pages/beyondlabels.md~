I am a research scientist who designs data-driven techniques for visual understanding at [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN) and more precisely in the [Φ-lab](http://blogs.esa.int/philab/), which develops future systems for Earth observation programmes.

My work is at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing and computer vision. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation, to bring solutions to current environment and population challenges.

I am an Associate Editor of the [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/). I co-organise the CVPR Earth Vision worskhop series (last edition: [CVPR'2020](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision'20 workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2020/)). I am currently a guest editor of [J. of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observation and Remote Sensing (JSTARS)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/jstars/) for the special issue about ["Computer Vision-based Approaches for Earth Observation"](http://www.grss-ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Call_for_Paper_Computer_Vision.pdf)

Previously, I did my PhD at with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/)/[Imedia team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/imedia) and [University of Versailles](http://www.uvsq.fr), near Paris, France. I also spent some time at [CNR](https://www.cnr.it/en) / [Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione (ISTI)](https://www.isti.cnr.it/) in Pisa, Italy, at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) / [Institut für Informatik](http://www.inf.unibe.ch/) in Bern, Switzerland, and at [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) (was Cachan) / [Centre des Mathématiques et de Leurs Applications (CMLA)](http://cmla.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-anglaise/). From 2008 to 2020, I was a research scientist at ONERA, the French aerospace laboratory, near Paris, France. I was interested in machine learning and computer vision for multimedia, robotics and Earth observation. 
 
I used to teach regularly at [University Paris Dauphine](https://www.dauphine.fr/en/welcome.html) (_Algorithms, from 2001 to 2003_) and [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (_Computer Vision Lab, from 2011 to 2017_), among other venues. From 2016 to 2020, I taught Machine Learning and Computer Vision at [Institut d'Optique Graduate School](https://www.institutoptique.fr) ([Univ. Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en)) and [ENSTA ParisTech](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). I also gave tutorials on _(Deep) Machine Learning_ at [JURSE'2019](http://www.jurse2019.org) and [IGARSS'2019](https://igarss2019.org/Tutorials.asp#FD3), and continual formation including on-line courses at [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/) / [Eduserv](http://www.eurosdr.net/education/course/eduserv17-2019).


I served as Chair of the [IEEE GRSS Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/) from 2017 to 2019, and previously as co-chair from 2015 to 2017. One of our main activities was to organize the [Data Fusion Contest](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/data-fusion-contest/), an annual competition for multimodal Earth observation. I was a co-organizer of the RFIAP'18/[TerraData workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/terradata2018) and the [CVPR'19](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2019/). In 2018/2019 I was a guest editor of [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/) special stream on [Advanced Processing for Multimodal Optical Remote Sensing Imagery](http://www.grss-ieee.org/letters/special-streams/multimodal-2018/).
