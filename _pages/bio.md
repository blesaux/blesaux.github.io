Bertrand Le Saux is policy officer for Green Deal (Destination Earth) and AI applications in DG CNECT at the European Commission. He is interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation and Earth sciences, to bring solutions to current environment and society challenges.

He received the Ms.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Institut National Polytechnique, Grenoble, France, in 1999, the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Versailles/Inria, Versailles, France, in 2003, and the Dr. Habilitation degree in physics from the University of Paris-Saclay, Saclay, France, in 2019. He has been for long a senior scientist working in the field of AI for Earth with ONERA the French Aerospace Laboratory in France and with the European Space Agency ϕ-lab in Italy. He has published more than 160 articles (including more than 50 in journal) on various aspects of visual understanding of the environment by data-driven techniques including computer vision and (quantum) machine learning.

Dr. Le Saux was Co-Chair (2015–2017) and chair (2017–2019) for the IEEE GRSS Technical Committee on Image Analysis and Data Fusion, and an Associate Editor of the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (2019-2024). He co-organised many workshops and events in machine learning x Earth observation, notably the CVPR Earth Vision workshop series, the ESA-ECMWF workshop series on Machine Learning for Earth System Observations and Predictions, the Weather4Cast competitions at NeurIPS, and the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HADR) workshops at ICCV and NeurIPS.
