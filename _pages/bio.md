Bertrand Le Saux is a Senior Scientist with the European Space Agency Φ-lab in Frascati, Italy. His research aims at visual understanding of the environment by data-driven techniques including computer vision and (quantum) machine learning. He is interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation, to bring solutions to current environment and society challenges. He received the Ms.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees from Institut National Polytechnique, Grenoble, France, in 1999, the Ph.D. degree from the University of Versailles/Inria, Versailles, France, in 2003, and the Dr. Habilitation degree from the University of Paris-Saclay, Saclay, France, in 2019. Dr. Le Saux was Co-Chair (2015–2017) and chair (2017–2019) for the IEEE GRSS Technical Committee on Image Analysis and Data Fusion. He is an Associate Editor of the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters. He co-organises many workshops and events in machine learning x Earth observation, notably the CVPR Earth Vision workshop series (including this year at CVPR’2023),  the ESA - ECMWF workshop series on Machine Learning for Earth System Observation and Prediction, and the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HADR) workshop at ICCV'2023.
