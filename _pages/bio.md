Bertrand Le Saux is a Senior Scientist with the European Space Agency Φ-lab in Frascati, Italy. His research interest aims at visual understanding of the environment by data-driven techniques including computer vision and (quantum) machine learning. He is interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation, to bring solutions to current environment and population challenges. He received the Ms.Eng. and M.Sc. degrees from Institut National Polytechnique, Grenoble, France, in 1999, the Ph.D. degree from the University of Versailles/Inria, Versailles, France, in 2003, and the Dr. Habilitation degree from the University of Paris-Saclay, Saclay, France, in 2019. Dr. Le Saux was Co-Chair (2015–2017) and chair (2017–2019) for the IEEE GRSS Technical Committee on Image Analysis and Data Fusion. He is now an Associate Editor of the Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters. He co-organises the Earth Vision workshop series at CVPR and the ESA - ECMWF workshops on Machine Learning for Earth System Observation and Prediction.
