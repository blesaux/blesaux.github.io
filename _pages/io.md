I'm a senior scientist specialising in data-driven methods for visual understanding — particularly in the context of our planet (AI for Earth). Over time, I developed a strong interest in strategic planning and now serve as a policy officer for Green Transition ([Destination Earth](https://destination-earth.eu/)) and AI applications with [DG Connect](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en) at the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en). Previously, I have been with the [Image-Vision-Learning team](https://www.onera.fr/en/dtis/research-units#iva) at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en) and the [Φ-lab](https://philab.phi.esa.int/) at [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN).

My research & innovation work has been for long at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and quantum computing. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation and Earth sciences, to bring solutions to current environment and society challenges. For recent works, check [my latest publications]({{ site.url }}/publications), [my last research topics]({{ site.url }}/projects), or [some resources on _learning beyond labels_]({{ site.url }}/beyondlabels).

I am a seasoned speaker in events related to AI, Earth observation, or Quantum Computing ([talk list]({{ site.url }}/talks)) as well as organiser of workshops and events (including CVPR / Earth Vision workshop series, [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) workshops on [Weather Forecast](https://weather4cast.net/neurips2024/) or [AI for Disaster Response](https://www.hadr.ai/), [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) / [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) workshops on [Machine Learning for Earth System Observation and Prediction](https://www.ml4esop.esa.int/), and the [Dagstuhl](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en) Seminar ['Space and Artificial Intelligence'](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/23461) — see below for full list). 

In earlier times, I did my [PhD]({{ site.url }}/publications/phd) at with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/)/[Imedia team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/imedia) and [University of Versailles](http://www.uvsq.fr), near Paris, France. I also spent some time at [CNR](https://www.cnr.it/en) / [Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione (ISTI)](https://www.isti.cnr.it/) in Pisa, Italy, at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) / [Institut für Informatik](http://www.inf.unibe.ch/) in Bern, Switzerland, and at [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) (was Cachan) / [Centre des Mathématiques et de Leurs Applications (CMLA)](http://cmla.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-anglaise/). From 2008 to 2020, I was a research scientist at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en), the French aerospace laboratory, near Paris, France, developing machine learning and computer vision for multimedia, robotics and in particular Earth observation (EO), as I pioneered the early developments of modern AI for EO (AI4EO). In 2019, I obtained my [Habilitation (HDR)]({{ site.url }}/publications/habil) from [University Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/doctoral-schools/sciences-and-technologies-information-and-communication). From 2020 to 2024, I served as senior scientist in digital technologies at the [Φ-lab](https://philab.phi.esa.int/), [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)'s innovation lab at [ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN) centre, near Rome, Italy. I advance AI applications in both upstream and downstream space sectors, focusing on enhancing AI's role in Climate and Earth sciences.
 
I used to teach regularly at [University Paris Dauphine](https://www.dauphine.fr/en/welcome.html) (_Algorithms, from 2001 to 2003_) and [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (_Computer Vision Lab, from 2011 to 2017_), among other venues. From 2016 to 2020, I taught _Machine Learning and Computer Vision_ at [Institut d'Optique Graduate School](https://www.institutoptique.fr) ([Univ. Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en)) and [ENSTA ParisTech](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). I also gave tutorials on _(Deep) Machine Learning_ at [JURSE'2019](http://www.jurse2019.org) and [IGARSS'2019](https://igarss2019.org/Tutorials.asp#FD3), and continual formation including on-line courses at [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/) / [Eduserv](http://www.eurosdr.net/education/course/eduserv17-2019).

I served as Chair of the [IEEE GRSS Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/) from 2017 to 2019, and previously as co-chair from 2015 to 2017. One of our main activities was to organize the [Data Fusion Contest](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/data-fusion-contest/), an annual competition for multimodal Earth observation. I have been an associate editor of the [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/) (2018-2024) and guest editor of several special issues mostly in IEEE journals.
