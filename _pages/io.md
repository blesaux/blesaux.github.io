I am a research scientist who designs data-driven techniques for visual understanding at [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN) and more precisely in the [Φ-lab](http://blogs.esa.int/philab/), which develops future systems for Earth observation programmes.

My work is at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and now quantum computing. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation, to bring solutions to current environment and population challenges.

I am an Associate Editor of the [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/). I co-organise the CVPR Earth Vision worskhop series (current/last edition: [CVPR'2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision'21 workshop](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/index.html).

In earlier times, I did my PhD at with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/)/[Imedia team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/imedia) and [University of Versailles](http://www.uvsq.fr), near Paris, France. I also spent some time at [CNR](https://www.cnr.it/en) / [Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione (ISTI)](https://www.isti.cnr.it/) in Pisa, Italy, at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) / [Institut für Informatik](http://www.inf.unibe.ch/) in Bern, Switzerland, and at [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) (was Cachan) / [Centre des Mathématiques et de Leurs Applications (CMLA)](http://cmla.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-anglaise/). From 2008 to 2020, I was a research scientist at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en), the French aerospace laboratory, near Paris, France, developing machine learning and computer vision for multimedia, robotics and Earth observation. In 2019, I obtained my [Habilitation (HDR)]({{ site.url }}/publications/habil) from [University Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/doctoral-schools/sciences-and-technologies-information-and-communication).
 
I used to teach regularly at [University Paris Dauphine](https://www.dauphine.fr/en/welcome.html) (_Algorithms, from 2001 to 2003_) and [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (_Computer Vision Lab, from 2011 to 2017_), among other venues. From 2016 to 2020, I taught Machine Learning and Computer Vision at [Institut d'Optique Graduate School](https://www.institutoptique.fr) ([Univ. Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en)) and [ENSTA ParisTech](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris). I also gave tutorials on _(Deep) Machine Learning_ at [JURSE'2019](http://www.jurse2019.org) and [IGARSS'2019](https://igarss2019.org/Tutorials.asp#FD3), and continual formation including on-line courses at [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/) / [Eduserv](http://www.eurosdr.net/education/course/eduserv17-2019).

I served as Chair of the [IEEE GRSS Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/) from 2017 to 2019, and previously as co-chair from 2015 to 2017. One of our main activities was to organize the [Data Fusion Contest](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/data-fusion-contest/), an annual competition for multimodal Earth observation. 
I was a co-organizer of:
* the RFIAP'18/[TerraData workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/terradata2018), 
* the [CVPR'19](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2019/), 
* the [CVPR'20](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision workshop](http://www.classic.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2020/), 
* the [CVPR'2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision'21 workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/), 
* the [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) - [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) workshops on [Machine Learning for Earth System Observation and Prediction](https://www.ml4esop.esa.int/) in 2020 and 2021, 
* the [2021 Workshop on Quantum Algorithms and Machine Learning for Huge Data Analysis, Simulation and Potential Earth Observation Applications](https://ellisqphml.github.io/ellisphilab2021) with [ELLIS society](https://ellis.eu/),
* the 2nd [conference on "Space and AI"](http://spaceandai.ijs.si/) co-located with [ECML-PKDD'21](https://2021.ecmlpkdd.org/) with [CLAIRE AI society](https://claire-ai.org).
I have been guest editor for:
* 2018/2019 [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/) special stream on [Advanced Processing for Multimodal Optical Remote Sensing Imagery](http://www.grss-ieee.org/letters/special-streams/multimodal-2018/).
* 2019/2020 [J. of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observation and Remote Sensing (JSTARS)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/jstars/) for the special issue about ["Computer Vision-based Approaches for Earth Observation"](http://www.grss-ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Call_for_Paper_Computer_Vision.pdf)
* 2021 [J. of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observation and Remote Sensing (JSTARS)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/jstars/) for the special issue about ["Quantum resources for Earth Observation"](http://www.grss-ieee.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/CFP.Quantum_resources_for_Earth_Observation.pdf)
