* \[April 18\] On April, 3rd, I will give a seminar at [Telecom Paristech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng)/[LTCI lab](https://ltci.telecom-paristech.fr/) about "Deep Learning for Scene Understanding, from 2D to 3D."
* \[April 18\] On April, 5th, we organize a Joint ONERA - CNAM workshop about Deep Learning for Earth Observation (with Élise Koeniguer and Martine Chanteclerc from ONERA, [Michel Crucianu](http://cedric.cnam.fr/~crucianm/) from CNAM and Blaise Pascal Chair awardee [Mihai Datcu](http://ceospacetech.pub.ro/index.php/m-mimospace-team/10-members/84-members-mihai-datcu)). Mihai Datcu will present an overview of the particularities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the fields of Earth Observation (EO). The focus will be on the methods of Deep Learning and their specificities for multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar.
* \[April 18\] The results of the 2018 Data Fusion Contest are [published](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/2018-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest-results/)! Congratulations to the winners and the participants who made more than 1300 submissions in our multimodal classification benchmark!
*  \[March 18\] Open-access to our [SnapNet article](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1Wj~eMFvHp9ws) on 3D point cloud semantic labeling in [Computer and Graphics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-graphics).
*  \[Fev. 18\] [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/) and I have two open PhD positions in our lab: one on ["Semi-supervised semantic segmentation for large-scale automated cartography"](../files/PhD_OBELIX-ONERA_semisupervised.pdf)  with Sébastien Lefèvre from IRISA (co-funded by CNES, please apply [here](https://cnes.fr/fr/les-ressources-humaines-du-cnes/segmentation-semantique-semi-supervisee-pour-la-cartographie)), and the other one on ["Neural networks for semantic segmentation of 3D data"](../files/PhD_IMAGINE-ONERA_pointcloud.pdf) (call in French) with Renaud Marlet from ENPC. 
*  \[Jan. 18\] On Jan. 15th, we (at [IADF TC](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/), with [University of Houston](http://hyperspectral.ee.uh.edu/)) launched the [2018 Data Fusion Contest](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/data-fusion-contest/), which consists in a classification benchmark with multimodal optical imagery: multispectral LiDAR, hyperspectral data and VHR RGB imagery. Do not miss this opportunity to test your algorithms!
