* \[July 2019\] [Ronny Hänsch](http://rhaensch.de/) (TU Berlin, Germany), [Devis Tuia](https://sites.google.com/site/devistuia/) (Uni Wangeningen, NL), [Yuliya Tarabalka](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Yuliya.Tarabalka/) (LuxCarta, FR) and myself will give a tutorial on [Machine Learning for Remote Sensing - Best practices and recent solutions](https://igarss2019.org/Tutorials.asp#FD3) at [IGARSS 2019](https://igarss2019.org), in Yokohama, Japan, on July 28th.
* \[June 2019\] Our review on _deep learning models for classification_ of remote sensing  hyperspectral data is finally published (after 2 years of much debated editorial process) in GRSM: [https://doi.org/10.1109/MGRS.2019.2912563](https://doi.org/10.1109/MGRS.2019.2912563). It comes with our DeepHyperX toolbox with several SOA networks for HSI: [https://github.com/nshaud/DeepHyperX](https://github.com/nshaud/DeepHyperX)
* \[June 2019\] The JSTARS paper about the outcome of the [2018 Data Fusion Contest](the Data Fusion Contest) that I co-organized with [Ronny Hänsch](http://rhaensch.de/) (TU Berlin, Germany), [Naoto Yokoya](http://naotoyokoya.com/) (RIKEN, JP) and [Saurabh Prasad](http://hyperspectral.ee.uh.edu/) (U. of Houston, US), is out! You can get it in open-access from [https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2911113](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2019.2911113). Please note that testing algorithms with this dataset is still possible on the [IEEE GRSS DASE website](the Data Fusion Contest )
* \[June 2019\] [Rodrigo Caye Daudt](https://rcdaudt.github.io/) got the Best Student Paper Award at [CVPR](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/)/[Earth Vision 2019](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2019/). Congrats!
* \[June 2019\] Not exactly an early-adopter, I now have a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/blesa_ux) to post news on a more regular basis.
