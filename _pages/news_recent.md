* \[May 18\] Check out our next 2 papers at [ICIP'2018](https://2018.ieeeicip.org/) and 5 papers at [IGARSS'2018](https://www.igarss2018.org/) on the [publication page](https://blesaux.github.io/publications/)
* \[May 18\] [Javiera Castillo Navarro](https://blesaux.github.io/students/javiera-msc) (MSc from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/fr/master-data-sciences)'s [Master Data Science](https://datascience-x-master-paris-saclay.fr/)) joins the lab as intern, working on "Large-scale semi-supervised semantic segmentation"
* \[April 18\] On April, 3rd, I will give a seminar at [Telecom Paristech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng)/[LTCI lab](https://ltci.telecom-paristech.fr/) about "Deep Learning for Scene Understanding, from 2D to 3D."
* \[April 18\] On April, 5th, we organize a Joint ONERA - CNAM workshop about Deep Learning for Earth Observation (with Élise Koeniguer and Martine Chanteclerc from ONERA, [Michel Crucianu](http://cedric.cnam.fr/~crucianm/) from CNAM and Blaise Pascal Chair awardee [Mihai Datcu](http://ceospacetech.pub.ro/index.php/m-mimospace-team/10-members/84-members-mihai-datcu)). Mihai Datcu will present an overview of the particularities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the fields of Earth Observation (EO). The focus will be on the methods of Deep Learning and their specificities for multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar.
* \[April 18\] The results of the 2018 Data Fusion Contest are [published](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/2018-ieee-grss-data-fusion-contest-results/)! Congratulations to the winners and the participants who made more than 1300 submissions in our multimodal classification benchmark!
