* \[Jan. 19\] I co-organize the 3rd [Earth Vision workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2019/) which is dedicated to large-scale computer vision for remote sensing imagery. It will be held in conjunction with CVPR'19 in June, at Long Beach, Cal., USA. Full paper submission deadline is on March, 7.
* \[Jan. 19\] [Javiera Castillo Navarro](students/javiera) joined the lab as PhD student. She will work on Large-scale semi-supervised semantic segmentation and is co-advised with [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/) and [Sebastien Lefèvre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/). Her PhD is co-funded by ONERA and [CNES](https://cnes.fr/en/web/CNES-en/7430-research-grants.php).
* \[Nov. 18\] On Nov. 20th, I will be at [Onera Scientific Days](https://www.onera.fr/agenda/jso-drones-2018) in Toulouse to talk about "Scene understanding with 2D and 3D data from UAVs".
* \[Nov. 18\] In November, we present our works on Deep Depth from Defocus a few times. On Nov. 9, [Marcela Carvalho](http://mcarvalho.ml/) and Pauline Trouvé will be at [Co-design days](http://www.gdr-isis.fr/index.php?page=reunion&idreunion=367) in Paris, and I will be at the [Computational photography days](https://compphoto.sciencesconf.org/) in Poitiers on Nov. 13.
