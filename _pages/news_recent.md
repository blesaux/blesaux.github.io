* \[May/June 2019\] [Javiera Castillo-Navarro](students/javiera) will be at [JURSE 2019](http://jurse2019.org/) to present our paper _"What data are needed for supervised semantic segmentation?_ and [Rodrigo Caye Daudt](https://rcdaudt.github.io/) will be at [CVPR](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/)/[Earth Vision 2019](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2019/) to present our paper on _Weakly-supervised change detection_.
* \[May 2019\] I will give a tutorial on _Deep Learning for Remote Sensing_ at [JURSE 2019](http://jurse2019.org/) with [Loïc Landrieu](https://loiclandrieu.com/). It will cover 2D and 3D, and include practical information to deploy deep learning approaches to remote sensing data.
* \[March 2019\] [Rémy Leroy](students/remy-msc) joined the lab as MSc. student intern, to work on _3D point-cloud prediction_. He is co-supervised with [Marcela Carvalho](students/marcela) and Pauline Trouvé-Peloux.
* \[March 2019\] I have [3 open PhD positions]({{ site.url }}/jobs) to work with me on deep machine learning for scene perception and understanding. 
* \[March. 19\] On March 4th and 5th, I will be in Barcelona to participate to the [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/education/course/eduserv17-2019) seminar for the course on [Deep Learning for Remote Sensing](http://www.eurosdr.net/sites/default/files/images/inline/eduserv2019_deeplearning.pdf) I will give with [Sébastien Lefèvre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/) and [Loïc Landrieu](https://loiclandrieu.com/).
