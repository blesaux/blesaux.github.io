* \[Nov. 18\] On Nov. 20th, I will be at [Onera Scientific Days](https://www.onera.fr/agenda/jso-drones-2018) in Toulouse to talk about "Scene understanding with 2D and 3D data from UAVs".
* \[Oct. 18\] [Nicolas Audebert](https://nicolas.audebert.at/) successfully defended his PhD on Oct. 17th, on the topic of *Classification of Big Earth-Observation Data*. Congratulations!
* \[Oct. 18\] [Nicolas Audebert](https://nicolas.audebert.at/), [Sébastien Lefèvre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/) and myself will be at [GDR ISIS day](http://www.gdr-isis.fr/index.php?page=reunion&idreunion=368) to present our work on Convolutional Neural Nets for Hyperspectral data and the associated [DeepHyperX toolbox](https://gitlab.inria.fr/naudeber/DeepHyperX)
* \[Oct. 18\] [Marcela Carvalho](http://mcarvalho.ml/) and [Rodrigo Daudt](https://rcdaudt.github.io/) will be at [ICIP'2018](https://2018.ieeeicip.org/) to present our works on (resp.) *loss functions for 3D depth estimations* and *fully-convolutioonal nets for change detection*
* \[September 18\] Our joint work on multitask learning wins overall the [3DRMS challenge](http://trimbot2020.webhosting.rug.nl/events/3drms/challenge)! A team work with [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/), [Marcela Carvalho](http://mcarvalho.ml/), [Maxime Ferrera](https://ferreram.github.io/), Julien Moras and Pauline Trouvé which also shows that learning on synthetic data allows to make 3D semantic mapping in real robotics environments! Talk at [ECCV](https://eccv2018.org/) [Workshop on 3D Reconstruction meets Semantics](http://trimbot2020.webhosting.rug.nl/events/3drms/) on Sept. 9th in Munich.
* \[September 18\] [Marcela Carvalho](http://mcarvalho.ml/) will present our paper on Deep Depth from Defocus at [ECCV](https://eccv2018.org/) [Workshop on 3D Reconstruction in the Wild](http://www.sys.info.hiroshima-cu.ac.jp/3drw2018/) on Sept 14th in Munich.
