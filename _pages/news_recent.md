* \[Oct. 2020\] I co-organise the [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) / [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) workshop on [Machine Learning for Earth Systems Observation and Prediction](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/learning/workshops/ecmwf-esa-workshop-machine-learning-earth-system-observation-and-prediction). Let see how Machine Learning and Earth sensing can help tackle the climate change effects! \[ [Programme](https://events.ecmwf.int/event/172/timetable/) / [Livestream](https://ecmwfevents.com/i/e1f887db-5d3c-44c4-bc8d-8a239d7094bf/login) \]
* \[Sep. 2020\] I am reviewer and committee in [Onur Tasar](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Onur.Tasar/)'s PhD defence, at [University of Nice](http://unice.fr/en) / [Inria Sophia-Antipolis](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre-inria-sophia-antipolis-mediterranee). Onur's thesis _From Satellite Images to Vector Maps_ was supervised by [Yuliya Tarabalka](http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Yuliya.Tarabalka/) and [Pierre Alliez](https://team.inria.fr/titane/pierre-alliez/).
* \[Sep. 2020\] [Gaston Lenczner)(https://github.com/gaslen) gets the <span style="color:orange;">Best Student Paper Award</span> at [ECML-PKDD 2020](https://ecmlpkdd2020.net/) / [MACLEAN](https://sites.google.com/view/maclean2020/): Congrats!
* \[Sep. 2020\] 2 papers at [ECML-PKDD 2020](https://ecmlpkdd2020.net/) / [MACLEAN](https://sites.google.com/view/maclean2020/) workshop: [_On Auxiliary Losses for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TAb4k6VgvTDZuw1LM7p8j3_QDXWBk5EZ/view?usp=sharing) by [Javiera Castillo-Navarro]({{ site.url }}/students/javiera) et al. and [_Interactive Learning for Semantic Segmentation in Earth Observation_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DzAwKGPvGvC7kOtN3FiqVZVAAFGU4-X/view?usp=sharing) by [Gaston Lenczner]({{ site.url }}/students/gaston) et al.
* \[August 2020\] Added a link to a public Trello Board with EO / ML / AI / CV conferences: [Night of the living deadlines](https://trello.com/b/4j8FEOWZ/night-of-the-living-deadlines).
* \[August 2020\] I appear on three papers at [ISPRS Congress 2020](http://www.isprs2020-nice.com/), including works by [Gaston Lenczner]({{ site.url }}/students/gaston) on deep interactive aerial image segmentation (DISIR) and [Clément Rambour]({{ site.url }}/students/clement) on flood mapping using Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery.
* \[June-Aug. 2020\] I helped mentoring teams participating to the Frontier Devlopment Lab's research sprints ([FDL 2020](https://fdleurope.org/fdl-europe-2020)), trying to get insights on challenges such as clouds dynamics or digital twin Earth.
* \[June 2020\] At [RFIAP'2020](https://cap-rfiap2020.sciencesconf.org/) ([link to papers](https://cap-rfiap2020.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/9)), the French conf. on Pattern Recognition and Learning, [Gaston Lenczner]({{ site.url }}/students/gaston) presents his work on Interactive Learning on Aerial Images [paper](https://cap-rfiap2020.sciencesconf.org/data/RFIAP_2020_paper_10.pdf) / [video](https://youtu.be/i-sOE6Q_aR8) and [Rémy Leroy]({{ site.url }}/students/remy) his research on 3D prediction by optimal transport [paper](https://cap-rfiap2020.sciencesconf.org/data/RFIAP_2020_paper_27.pdf).
