* \[April 18\] On April, 3rd, I will give a talk at Telecom ParisTech about "Deep Learning for Scene Understanding, from 2D to 3D."
* \[April 18\] On April, 5th, we organize a Joint ONERA - CNAM workshop about Deep Learning for Earth Observation (with Élise Koeniguer and Martine Chanteclerc from ONERA, [Michel Crucianu](http://cedric.cnam.fr/~crucianm/) from CNAM and Blaise Pascal Chair awardee [Mihai Datcu](http://ceospacetech.pub.ro/index.php/m-mimospace-team/10-members/84-members-mihai-datcu)). Mihai Datcu will present an overview of the particularities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the fields of Earth Observation (EO). The focus will be on the methods of Deep Learning and their specificities for multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar.
*  \[March 18\] Open-access to our [SnapNet article](https://authors.elsevier.com/c/1Wj~eMFvHp9ws) on 3D point cloud semantic labeling in [Computer and Graphics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/computers-and-graphics).
*  \[Fev. 18\] [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/) and I have two open PhD positions in our lab: one on ["Semi-supervised semantic segmentation for large-scale automated cartography"](../files/PhD_OBELIX-ONERA_semisupervised.pdf)  with Sébastien Lefèvre from IRISA (co-funded by CNES, please apply [here](https://cnes.fr/fr/les-ressources-humaines-du-cnes/segmentation-semantique-semi-supervisee-pour-la-cartographie)), and the other one on ["Neural networks for semantic segmentation of 3D data"](../files/PhD_IMAGINE-ONERA_pointcloud.pdf) (call in French) with Renaud Marlet from ENPC. 
*  \[Jan. 18\] On Jan. 15th, we (at [IADF TC](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/), with [University of Houston](http://hyperspectral.ee.uh.edu/)) launched the [2018 Data Fusion Contest](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/data-fusion-contest/), which consists in a classification benchmark with multimodal optical imagery: multispectral LiDAR, hyperspectral data and VHR RGB imagery. Do not miss this opportunity to test your algorithms!
*   \[Nov. 17\] [Jorris Guerry](http://jorisguerry.fr/) successfully defended his PhD thesis about "visual recognition by neural networks for robotics" at [École Polytechnique](http://www.polytechnique.edu) on Nov. 20th. Congratulations !
*   \[Nov 17\] [Nicolas Audebert](https://nicolas.audebert.at/) got nice results) with a new approach on the [Inria Aerial dataset](): more than 71% IoU for detecting buildings in aerial images.
*   \[Oct. 17\] Rodrigo Daudt joined the lab as a PhD student, co-supervised by [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/), [Yann Gousseau](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/index_eng.html) from [Telecom Paristech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng)/[LTCI lab](https://ltci.telecom-paristech.fr/) and myself. He will work on analysis of multi-temporal activity in Earth-observation data.
