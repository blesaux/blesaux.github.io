* \[July 2021\] At [IGARSS'21](https://igarss2021.com/) I (co-)organise 2 invited sessions on ["Humans, data and AI in Earth observation"](https://igarss2021.com/view_session.php?SessionID=1273) and ["Physics-aware ML and Simulation"](https://igarss2021.com/view_session.php?SessionID=1334) and one special event on ["EO data in the New Space era"](https://igarss2021.com/special_events.php).
* \[June 2021\] The 5th [Earth Vision workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2021/) I helped co-organising takes place at [CVPR 2021](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/) on June 19th, full day. 
* \[May 2021\] I co-organise the ELLIS-ESA [Workshop on Quantum Algorthms and Machine Learning for Huge Data Analysis, Simulation and Potential Earth Observation Applications](https://ellisqphml.github.io/ellisphilab2021), held virtually on May 27th.
* \[March 2021\] Happy to join [Sofia Vallecorsa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofia-vallecorsa-93ab36b1/) to co-supervise the PhD of [Su-Yeon Chang](https://people.epfl.ch/su.chang/?lang=en) to explore "Quantum Generative Neural Networks for Image Analysis" at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch)/[LTPN](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ltpn/), [CERN](https://home.cern/)/[Open Lab](https://openlab.cern/) and [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[Φ-lab](https://philab.phi.esa.int/).
* \[March 2021\] Happy to join [Devis Tuia](https://sites.google.com/site/devistuia/) and [Sylvain Lobry](https://www.sylvainlobry.com/) to co-supervise the PhD of [Christel Chappuis](https://people.epfl.ch/christel.chappuis/?lang=en) to design "an AI assistant to visual query and answering for EO data" at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch)/[ECEO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/) and [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[Φ-lab](https://philab.phi.esa.int/).
