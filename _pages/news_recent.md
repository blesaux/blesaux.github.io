* \[March 2019\] [Rémy Leroy](students/remy) joined the lab as MSc. student intern, co-supervised with [Marcela Carvalho](students/marcela) and Pauline Trouvé-Peloux.
* \[March 2019\] I have [3 open PhD positions]({{ site.url }}/jobs) to work with me on deep machine learning for scene perception and understanding. 
* \[March. 19\] On March 4th and 5th, I will be in Barcelona to participate to the [EuroSDR](http://www.eurosdr.net/education/course/eduserv17-2019) seminar for the course on [Deep Learning for Remote Sensing](http://www.eurosdr.net/sites/default/files/images/inline/eduserv2019_deeplearning.pdf) I will give with [Sébastien Lefèvre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/) and [Loïc Landrieu](https://loiclandrieu.com/).
* \[Feb. 19\] On Feb. 8th, I'll give a talk about "deep learning for scene perception and understanding" for ONERA's [scientific high council](https://www.onera.fr/en/scientific-high-council).
* \[Jan. 19\] We at [IADF](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/) launched the [2019 Data Fusion Contest](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/data-fusion-contest/), co-organized with Johns Hopkins University! It deals with Large-Scale Semantic 3D Reconstruction and aims to reconstruct both a 3D geometric model and a segmentation of semantic classes for urban scenes. It is cast as a 4-track competition: single-view semantic 3D, pairwise semantic stereo, mutli-view semantic stereo and 3D point-cloud classification.
* \[Jan. 19\] I co-organize the 3rd [Earth Vision workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2019/) which is dedicated to large-scale computer vision for remote sensing imagery. It will be held in conjunction with [CVPR'19](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/program/workshops) in June, at Long Beach, Cal., USA. Full paper submission deadline is on March, 7.
* \[Jan. 19\] [Javiera Castillo Navarro](students/javiera) joined the lab as PhD student. She will work on Large-scale semi-supervised semantic segmentation and is co-advised with [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/) and [Sebastien Lefèvre](http://people.irisa.fr/Sebastien.Lefevre/). Her PhD is co-funded by ONERA and [CNES](https://cnes.fr/en/web/CNES-en/7430-research-grants.php).
* \[Nov. 18\] Former PhD student [Joris Guerry](students/joris) got the PhD Award in "Complex Systems Engineering" from the [doctoral school Interfaces](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/formation/doctorat/interfaces#evenements). Congrats!
