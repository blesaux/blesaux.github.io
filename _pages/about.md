I am a research scientist who designs data-driven techniques for visual understanding in the [Î¦-lab](https://philab.phi.esa.int/) at [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN).

My work is at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and now quantum computing. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation, to bring solutions to current environment and population challenges. For current works, check [the resources on _learning beyond labels_]({{ site.url }}/beyondlabels) or [my latest publications]({{ site.url }}/publications).

I am an associate editor of the [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/). I co-organise the CVPR Earth Vision worskhop series (this year's edition: [CVPR'2022](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision'22 workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/events/earthvision-2022/)) and the ESA-ECMWF Machine Learning for Earth System Observation and Prediction workshop series (last year's edition: [ML4ESOP'2021](https://www.ml4esop.esa.int/)). I am currently a guest editor of [J. of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observation and Remote Sensing (JSTARS)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/jstars/) for the special issue about ["Quantum resources for Earth Observation"]({{ site.url }}/files/CFP.Quantum_resources_for_Earth_Observation2022.pdf) til end of December 2022.
