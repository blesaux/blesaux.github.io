I'm a senior scientist specialising in data-driven methods for visual understanding — particularly in the context of our planet (AI for Earth). Over time, I developed a strong interest in strategic planning and now serve as a policy officer for Green Transition ([Destination Earth](https://destination-earth.eu/)) and AI applications with [DG Connect](https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/communications-networks-content-and-technology_en) at the [European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index_en). Previously, I have been with the [Image-Vision-Learning team](https://www.onera.fr/en/dtis/research-units#iva) at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en) and the [Φ-lab](https://philab.phi.esa.int/) at [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN).

My research & innovation work has been for long at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and quantum computing. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation and Earth sciences, to bring solutions to current environment and society challenges. To explore my most recent works, you can consult [my latest publications]({{ site.url }}/publications), [my last research topics]({{ site.url }}/projects), or [some resources on _learning beyond labels_]({{ site.url }}/beyondlabels). For a broader perspective or earlier contributions, check [earlier research topics]({{ site.url }}/projects/finished), my [Doctor Habilitation (HDR), 2019]({{ site.url }}/publications/habil) from [University Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) or my [PhD, 2003]({{ site.url }}/publications/phd) from [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en) and [University of Versailles](https://www.uvsq.fr/uvsq).

I am a seasoned speaker in events related to AI, Earth observation, or Quantum Computing ([talk list]({{ site.url }}/talks)) as well as organiser of workshops and events (including the CVPR Earth Vision worskhop series (e.g. [CVPR'2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024)/[EarthVision'24 workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/events/earthvision-2024/)), the [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) workshops on [Weather Forecast](https://weather4cast.net/neurips2024/) or [AI for Disaster Response](https://www.hadr.ai/), the [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) / [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) workshops on Machine Learning for Earth System Observation and Prediction ([#1](https://www.ml4esop.esa.int/), [#2](https://events.ecmwf.int/event/304/)), and the [Dagstuhl](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en) Seminar ['Space and Artificial Intelligence'](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/23461) in 2023. I have been co-chair (2015–2017) and chair (2017–2019) for the [IEEE GRSS](https://www.grss-ieee.org/) [Technical Committee on Image Analysis and Data Fusion](https://www.grss-ieee.org/technical-committees/image-analysis-and-data-fusion/), an associate editor of the [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/) (2018-2024) and guest editor of several special issues mostly in IEEE journals.
