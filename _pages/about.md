I am a research scientist who designs data-driven techniques for visual understanding in the [Phi-lab](http://blogs.esa.int/philab/) at [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN).

My work is at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing and computer vision. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation, to bring solutions to current environment and population challenges.

I am an associate editor of the [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/). I co-organise the CVPR Earth Vision worskhop series (last edition: [CVPR'2020](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision'20 workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2020/)).
