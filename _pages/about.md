I am a research scientist who designs data-driven techniques for visual understanding at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en)/[DTIS](https://www.onera.fr/en/dtis-information-processing-and-systems), the French aerospace research centre.

My work is at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing and computer vision. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in multimedia, remote sensing and robotics.

Besides that, I teach Image Processing and Computer Vision Research Work at [École Polytechnique](http://www.polytechnique.edu) and Machine Learning at [Institut d'Optique Graduate School](https://www.institutoptique.fr) and [ENSTA ParisTech](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr). I also serve as Chair of the [IEEE GRSS Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/).

## News

*  \[Fev. 18\] [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/) and I have two open PhD positions in our lab: one on ["Semi-supervised semantic segmentation for large-scale automated cartography"](../files/PhD_OBELIX-ONERA_semisupervised.pdf)  with Sébastien Lefèvre from IRISA (co-funded by CNES, please apply [here](https://cnes.fr/fr/les-ressources-humaines-du-cnes/segmentation-semantique-semi-supervisee-pour-la-cartographie)), and the other one on ["Neural networks for semantic segmentation of 3D data"](../files/PhD_IMAGINE-ONERA_pointcloud.pdf) (call in French) with Renaud Marlet from ENPC. 
*  \[Jan. 18\] On Jan. 15th, we (at [IADF TC](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/), with [University of Houston](http://hyperspectral.ee.uh.edu/)) launched the [2018 Data Fusion Contest](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/data-fusion-contest/), which consists in a classification benchmark with multimodal optical imagery: multispectral LiDAR, hyperspectral data and VHR RGB imagery. Do not miss this opportunity to test your algorithms!
*   \[Nov. 17\] [Jorris Guerry](http://jorisguerry.fr/) successfully defended his PhD thesis about "visual recognition by neural networks for robotics" at [École Polytechnique](http://www.polytechnique.edu) on Nov. 20th. Congratulations !
*   \[Nov 17\] [Nicolas Audebert](https://nicolas.audebert.at/) got nice results with a new approach on the [Inria Aerial dataset](): more than 71% IoU for detecting buildings in aerial images.
*   \[Oct. 17\ Rodrigo Daudt joined the lab as a PhD student, co-supervised by [Alexandre Boulch](https://aboulch.github.io/), [Yann Gousseau](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/gousseau/index_eng.html) from [Telecom Paristech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng)/[LTCI lab](https://ltci.telecom-paristech.fr/) and myself. He will work on analysis of multi-temporal activity in Earth-observation data.
*   \[Oct. 17\] I will deliver a keynote talk about "Semantic Labeling of Remote Sensing Data from 2D to 3D" at [TUM](https://www.lmf.bgu.tum.de/en/home/)-[DLR](http://www.dlr.de/eoc/en/) [Remote Sensing Summer School](https://www.lmf.bgu.tum.de/tumdlrss17/) on Oct. 4-6th.
*   \[Oct. 17\] I will be at [ICCV](http://iccv2017.thecvf.com/) workshop on [3D Reconstruction meets Semantics](http://trimbot2020.webhosting.rug.nl/events/3drms/) to speak about a SnapNet variation for robotics. SnapNet is our multi-view CNN for point cloud labeling, and we used it to perform 3D-consistent data augmentation, which results in state-of-the-art performances in semantic segmentation on SunRGBD and NYUv2 datasets.
