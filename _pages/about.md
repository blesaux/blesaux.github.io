I am a senior scientist who manages research and designs data-driven techniques for visual understanding, in particular for our planet: AI for Earth, for short. I am currently with DG Connect at the European Commission. Previously, I have been with the [Image-Vision-Learning team](https://www.onera.fr/en/dtis/research-units#iva) at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en) and the [Î¦-lab](https://philab.phi.esa.int/) at [ESA](http://www.esa.int/)/[ESRIN](http://www.esa.int/About_Us/ESRIN).

My work is at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing, computer vision, and now quantum computing. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in Earth observation, to bring solutions to current environment and population challenges. For current works, check [the resources on _learning beyond labels_]({{ site.url }}/beyondlabels) or [my latest publications]({{ site.url }}/publications).

I am a seasoned speaker in events related to AI, Earth observation, or Quantum Computing ([talk list]({{ site.url }}/talks)) as well as organiser of workshops and events (including the CVPR Earth Vision worskhop series (e.g. [CVPR'2024](https://cvpr.thecvf.com/Conferences/2024)/[EarthVision'24 workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/events/earthvision-2024/)), [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) workshops on [Weather Forecast](https://weather4cast.net/neurips2024/) or [AI for Disaster Response](https://www.hadr.ai/), [ESA](https://www.esa.int/) / [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int/) workshops on Machine Learning for Earth System Observation and Prediction ([#1](https://www.ml4esop.esa.int/), [#2](https://events.ecmwf.int/event/304/)). I was an associate editor of the [Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters (GRSL)](http://www.grss-ieee.org/publication-category/grsl/) and guest editor of several special issues in IEEE journals.
