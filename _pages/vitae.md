I am a research scientist who designs data-driven techniques for visual understanding at [ONERA](https://www.onera.fr/en)/[DTIS](https://www.onera.fr/en/dtis-information-processing-and-systems), the French aerospace research centre.

My work is at the crossroads of statistics, machine learning, image processing and computer vision. I am interested in tackling practical problems that arise in multimedia, remote sensing and robotics.

Besides that, I teach Machine Learning and Computer Vision at [Institut d'Optique Graduate School](https://www.institutoptique.fr) ([Univ. Paris Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en)) and [ENSTA ParisTech](https://www.ensta-paristech.fr) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris).

Previously, I did my PhD at with [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/)/[Imedia team](https://www.inria.fr/en/teams/imedia) and [University of Versailles](http://www.uvsq.fr), near Paris, France. I also spent some time at [CNR](https://www.cnr.it/en) / [Istituto di Scienza e Tecnologie dell'Informazione (ISTI)](https://www.isti.cnr.it/) in Pisa, Italy, at [University of Bern](https://www.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) / [Institut für Informatik](http://www.inf.unibe.ch/) in Bern, Switzerland, and at [ENS Paris Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) (was Cachan) / [Centre des Mathématiques et de Leurs Applications (CMLA)](http://cmla.ens-paris-saclay.fr/version-anglaise/) near Paris, France.

I used to teach regularly at [University Paris Dauphine](https://www.dauphine.fr/en/welcome.html) (_Algorithms_) and [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) (_Computer Vision Lab_), among other venues. I also gave tutorials on _(Deep) Machine Learning_ at JURSE'2019 and IGARSS'2019.

I served as Chair of the [IEEE GRSS Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee](http://www.grss-ieee.org/community/technical-committees/data-fusion/) from 2017 to 2019, and previously as co-chair from 2015 to 2017. I was a co-organizer of the RFIAP'18/[TerraData workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/terradata2018) and the [CVPR'19](http://cvpr2019.thecvf.com/)/[EarthVision workshop](https://www.grss-ieee.org/earthvision2019/).
